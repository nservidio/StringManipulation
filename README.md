# StringManipulation
A string manipulator.

The user will enter some text.

There will be two buttons.

If the user presses "Get Statistics", they will see a system alert view that includes the current statistics of the text in the text field.

If the user presses "Abbreviate", the text in the field will be altered based on the number of characters in the word. e.g. “Tacos are delicious." will become: “T3s a1e d7s.”
